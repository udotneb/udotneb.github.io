	Dear Diary,
	<br><br>
	The entire ride was in +100 AQI. Challenging my body with small particulates will force my body to adapt into a higher being. Darwin said so himself. By exposing myself to substances that would be normally carcinogenic to a regular, plebian human, I will gain immunity to all potentially hazardous situations. This is a good philosophy not only for improving the body's physical limits, but also for situations involving criminals and women.

	The first 30 miles through Sacramento were beutiful and as flat as the second derivative of a parabola. 
	At the 30 mile mark that all changed when Rachel joined. It provided sandwiches and an extra 10 pounds of weight.

	For anyone who is as intellectual individual such as myself, I recommend you enrich yourself with the podcast Philosophy Bites. 
	I listened to the one about Neetshe today about the camel and lion and child. 
	In both appearance and disposition, I can say for certain after deep introspection that I am the lion.
	My biking partner was a camel but still required much water and would not carry weight. 
	In essence, useless and burdensome.
	<br><br>


	Got our first flat today. It's rachels tire of course.
	<br>
	Also took our first road side shit today. It was me of course.
