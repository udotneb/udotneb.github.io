	Dear Diary,
	Today I woke up and took a very long poo. 

	The entire ride was in +100 AQI. Challenging my body with small particulates will force my body to adapt into a higher being. Darwin said so himself. By exposing myself to substances that would be normally carcinogenic to a regular, plebian human, I will gain immunity to all potentially hazardous situations. This is a good philosophy not only for improving the body's physical limits, but also for situations involving criminals and women. 

	The first 30 miles through Sacramento were as flat as the second derivative of a parabola. I met my demise 30 miles in the form of a chuck yang tobbleyanger. It provided sandwiches and an extra 10 pounds of weight. 

	For anyone who is as intellectual individual such as myself, I recommend you enrich yourself with the podcast Philosophy Bites. 
	I listened to the one about Neetshe today about the camel and lion and child. 
	In both appearance and disposition, I can say for certain after deep introspection that I am the lion.
	My biking partner was a camel but still required much water and would not carry weight. 
	In essence, useless and burdensome.

	-Rachel Lou on my day today

		Had a bumblebee tag along for about an hour. 
		Was too afraid to brush it off because my clothing was really thin and a bee string to my thigh would've been terrbible for biking, 
		but the little guy turned out to be friendly enough.

		One of my biggest fears with this trip is how much muscle I end up losing.
		Started the trip at ~178 pounds and joked with my family that I wouldn't be coming back unless I was atleast 180 pounds. 
		One of my friends made a bet that he would be heavier than me by the end of the trip (he's 125 pounds as of yesterday)
		I arrived into elk grove about 6 miles from my motel at around 2 and since the checkin was at 3 I decided to try to eat a big 
		lunch to recooperate some of the 5000?? calories strava said I burned.
		Got a large peanut butter mood from jamba juice and my classic chipotle chicken bowl order, totalling ~2000 calories but it turned out to be a huge waste.	
		I think I was really dehydrated because all of it ended up in the bushes right outside of chipotle :(
		Definitely going to be more careful on the hot days coming up.
